ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, stranger!

Iâ€™m Ivan (iskolyar@gmail.com). Iâ€™m interested in C++ and gamedev now.

In my repositories you can find different C++ code samples:
- 'my-patterns' - implementation of popular programming patterns.
- 'algorithms-and-data-structured' - simple code of different algorithms and data structures.
- 'concurrency-learning' - projects where I use some multithreading.
- 'UE4-simple-sphere-shooter' - Unreal Engine 4 test sphere shooter game based on first person template

Each repository is gradually filled up with source files, so if you cant find something popular, dont get upset. It will be here soon.

<!---
