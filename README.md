ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, stranger!

Iâ€™m Ivan. Iâ€™m interested in C++ and gamedev now.

In my repositories you can find different C++ code samples and projects:
- 'my-patterns' - implementation of popular programming patterns.
- 'concurrency-learning' - projects where I use some multithreading.
- 'UE4-simple-sphere-shooter' - my small first person shooter game. 
- 'learning-opengl' - my opengl-cmake learning path 

Each repository is gradually filled up with source files, so if you cant find something popular, dont get upset. It will be here soon.
