Here you can find different C++ code samples.
Repository 'my-patterns' is devoted to implementation of popular programming patterns.
In 'algorithms-and-data-structured' repository you can find simple code of different algorithms and data structures.

Each repository is gradually filled up with source files, so if you cant find something popular, dont get upset. It will be here soon.

<!---
ivan-mitrich/ivan-mitrich is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
